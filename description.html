        <p class="head1">Gender Inequality In STEM</p>
        <p class="para1">Gender inequality in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) refers to the significant disparity in representation and opportunities between genders in these fields. Women and marginalized groups continue to face challenges such as societal stereotypes, unequal access to quality education, gender-biased hiring practices, and limited role models in STEM industries. These barriers discourage participation and hinder their growth in STEM careers. This lack of diversity not only results in missed opportunities for talented individuals but also limits innovation, economic growth, and the ability to address complex global challenges through diverse perspectives. Bridging this gap is essential for creating a fair and inclusive society where everyone can contribute to advancements in science and technology.</p>
        <p class="head2">Project Aim</p>
        <p class="para2">Our project aims to analyze and address gender inequality in STEM through a data-driven approach, with a primary focus on visualizing the extent of disparities. The application allows users to upload and work with any dataset related to gender inequality, enabling flexibility in analyzing various aspects of the issue. By generating dynamic visualizations such as graphs and charts, the project helps to highlight key trends, patterns, and areas where gender disparities are most pronounced. This tool is designed to provide users with actionable insights and raise awareness, ultimately contributing to fostering inclusivity and equality in STEM fields.</p>
